## ASSEMBLY.PY

The `assembly.py` file serves as the master file for the application, housing wrapper functions for various features. The core logic for each feature resides in separate files, including `TaggerClassifier`, `PatternDetection_refactored`, `MySQL`, and `TagClassifier`. Additionally, users have the flexibility to provide arguments such as Minimum Log Time, Minimum Value of Alpha, Minimum Pattern Length, Minimum Pattern Repetition, and Maximum Pattern Length while executing the file.
<br><br>
### GetIntervalLogs Function

- The `GetIntervalLogs` function begins by establishing a hashmap indexed by assignment ID and user ID, utilizing a provided list of tags. It proceeds to compute interval logs for each value using the methodology outlined in the `TaggerClassifier` file. The resulting table is then saved into a file named `Interval_logs.csv`.
<br><br>
### getUserHistory Function

- Within the `getUserHistory` function, credibility scores are computed for a given list of tags. The calculation leverages the algorithms from the `TaggerClassifier` file. Following score computation, the function cleanses HTML tags from the output and records the credibility scores into a file named `userdata.csv`.
<br><br>
### getKrippendorfAlpha Function

- This function is tasked with obtaining the Krippendorf Alpha value for each user. Initially, it aggregates all tag prompt IDs for the answers of a team. Subsequently, for each tag prompt ID, it collects the raters' data. This data is then passed to the `KrippendorfAlpha` function within the `TaggerClassifier`. The resulting output is written to a CSV file.
<br><br>
### getPatternResults Function

- Utilizing a provided list of tags, `getPatternResults` function populates a user-assignment hashmap. Subsequently, it delegates this data to the `patternDetectionResult` function within the `PatternDetection` file. The outcomes are written to a file named `Patternrecognition.txt`.
<br><br>
### CalculateCredibility Function

- This function calculates credibility scores by averaging normalized log time, alpha, and total characters.
<br><br>
### CombineCSVResults Function

- The `CombineCSVResults` function consolidates all CSV and TXT files into a single file based on assignment ID and UserID. It addresses edge cases, such as those with no patterns, and computes credibility scores using the `CalculateCredibility` function.
<br><br><br>
## MySQL.py

This file facilitates connection to a MySQL database, where a dump file is currently utilized to operate the database. Once connected, the file provides helper functions for interacting with the database.
<br><br>
### getAnswerTags Function

- This function executes an inner join operation on `AnswerTags` and `TagPromptDeployments`, returning a list of `AnswerTags` with associated `AssignmentID`.
<br><br>
### getUserTeams Function

- `getUserTeams` retrieves all tags for a specific team across all assignments from the database. It organizes the data into a dictionary format: `{assignment_id: {team_id: {user_id: {answer_id: {tag_prompt_id: tag}}}}}`.
<br><br><br>
## TaggerClassifier.py

This component categorizes tags as either reliable or unreliable, employing various algorithms and metrics.
<br><br>
### BuildIntervalLogs Function

- `BuildIntervalLogs` computes the logarithm base 2 of time differences between two consecutive tags and returns the average of the result.
<br><br>
### intervalLogsforTags Function

- Within this function, interval log values are computed from a list of tags.
<br><br>
### compute_Krippendorff_Alpha Function

- Utilizing the Krippendorf alpha library, this function calculates the alpha value based on a 2-dimensional array of raters and tag prompts. The calculation is omitted if there is insufficient variation.
<br><br>
### CalculateTagCredibilityScore Function

- By integrating fast-tagging values and Krippendorff Alpha, credibility scores are generated for each tag ID. The score is determined by averaging normalized alpha and interval logs.
<br><br><br>
## TagClassifier.py

- This file contains a function to calculate agreement/disagreement amongst peers.

- We provide the function `calculateAgreementDisagreement` with a 2D array of raters and `tagpromptID`.

- For each iteration of the 2D array, we get a new `tagpromptID`, and we determine the most common rating for that ID. It then calculates the fraction of users who agree with the common rating and who donâ€™t. The values are returned by the function in the form of a dictionary.
<br><br><br>
## PatternDetection.py

This Python code defines a class called `PatternDetection`, which contains methods for detecting patterns in binary data. Here is an explanation of each part of the code:
<br><br>
### PlaceHolderNode Class

- This is a nested class within `PatternDetection`.
- It's used as a custom data structure to store information about positions (LP and SP).
<br><br>
### CheckPattern Method

- This method checks for a specific pattern within a given interval.
- It takes the starting index (`lptr`), ending index (`rptr`), pattern length (`period`), and binary data (`bin_data`) as input parameters.
- It returns a list containing a boolean indicating if a pattern is found, the pattern itself, and the number of repetitions.
<br><br>
### PeriodicityCheck Method

- This method performs periodicity check and validation on the binary data for a given period.
- It takes binary data (`bin_data`), pattern length (`period`), and minimum number of repetitions (`min_tags`) as input parameters.
- It uses a custom data structure (`PlaceHolderNode`) to keep track of LP (last position) and SP (start position) for each position in the period.
- It iterates through the data and updates LP and SP based on certain conditions.
- It calls the `CheckPattern` method to check for patterns within the specified intervals.
- Returns a list containing a boolean indicating if a pattern is found, the pattern itself, and the number of repetitions.
<br><br>
### PTV Method

- Stands for Pattern Time Variation.
- It sorts a list of tags based on their creation time and converts them into binary data.
- It iterates through different pattern lengths (`Lmin` to `Lmax`) and calls the `PeriodicityCheckAllPatterns` method for each length.
- Returns a list of patterns found with their counts.
<br><br>
### PeriodicityCheckAllPatterns Method

- Similar to `PeriodicityCheck`, but it iterates through all patterns within a given period.
- It calls the `CheckPattern` method for each pattern and accumulates the results.
- Returns a list of patterns found with their counts.
